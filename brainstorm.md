Initial brainstorming ideas: 

1. app that reminds users of their tasks
    - users can set deadlines for when they want to be done with a task, like an internship application, homework deadline, etc

2. buget-planning app that keeps track of income and spending habits
     - users can set up goals to divide their income (eg: 50% housing, 10% food, 10% clothes/vacation/restaurants, 20% saving etc)
     - users can take photos of receipts to keep track of them
     - targetted at college students to be smarter with money
     - create goals like trip to Europe and add money in such as if someone had leftover money from the clothes/vacation/restaurants category for that month

3. app that makes it easier for users to find locations to meet up at

4. app where users can sign up as pet sitters and owners can be matched with a pet sitter

5. app that recommends movies to users based on movies they like and dislike

6. app that helps aquarium hobbyists discover which species of fish are compatible for various tank sizes
