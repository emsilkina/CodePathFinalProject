App Overview: This app, PiggyBank, will allow users to set smart money-management goals. The point of it would be to budget your income and allow users to save up money towards goals such as their dream vacations.

App Spec: 
1. There will be a screen where users can access their current goals and add new goals. When clicking on current goals, they can slowly allocate money towards them (like +$5 of +$20). With these small increments, their goals can be realized and they can have enough money saved up.
2. Can add and decrease money. Ideally, the app would be connected to debit cards to track spending automatically.However, for the sake of this small project, users can instead keep track of the money they've spent and can also take photos of receipts for proofs of purchase.
